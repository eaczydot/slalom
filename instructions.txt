I am developing a demo environent of a private company shareholder management platform.

The platform will allow a private company to manage its shareholders, directors, and officers. It will also allow shareholders to manage their shares, dividends, and other relevant information.

I would like you to develop a simple prototype of the platform exactly replicating the screenshots I will attach (note: these screenshots are from an iphone and I want the style adopted to be used in desktop view)
